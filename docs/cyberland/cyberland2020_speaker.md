## Q&A

Q: How do I setup the online conferencing software?  
A: You'll get a link from our online conferencing software that contains this information. There is no special setup or installation needed.

Q: How long is my talk?  
A: It should be 40 minutes long plus 5 minutes Q&A. Be aware that there is a hard time limit. This means that the Webinar will kick out all participiants after 45 minutes.


Q: How can I interact with the audience?  
A: There is a chat, an Q&A as well as a poll. The host of you session will go through theses features with you before your session starts. You can also prepare polls that the hosts will hack into the conferencing tool.
